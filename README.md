# The Next Web Clone

> In this project, I get the chance to build a responsive website. I cloned The Next Web (*as per [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-responsive-design)*), a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced. The process builds on the skills utilized in the previous projects done from [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).
